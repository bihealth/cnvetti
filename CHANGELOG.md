# CNVetti CHANGELOG

## HEAD (v0.1.0; unreleased)

- Adding `cnvetti cmd` sub commands:
    - `coverage` (genome-wide fragments/coverage, or target-wise fragments)
    - `normalize` (normalize with total coverage or by GC-wise median)
    - `merge-cov` (merge coverage BCF files)
- Starting out with CLI skelleton for `cnvetti cmd *`.
